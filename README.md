# JavaSpringAPIBackend
## I plan to connect this to an angular project in the future to create an end to end full stack app :)
### Created my own api for a database of employees using the java spring boot library
### This project communicates with a local SQL server to recieve HTTP requests from any front end to read and write data (post get put delete)
### By extending the JPA repo, this project can write tables directly to the SQL server.
